= Using android-vnc-viewer =

*android-vnc-viewer* lets you use your Android mobile device as a client for a VNC server.  It is a work in progress and still has a number of limitations: for example, it does not support display of VNC servers representing multiple monitors.

== Connection Configuration ==
When you first open *android-vnc-viewer*, you will see a connection configuration page.  Here you can set up a connection with a VNC server, or choose an already configured connection.

The page is divided into two sections.  The top section contains a drop-down list of the connection configurations you've created.  The first time you run android-vnc-viewer, this list will have only one entry: _New_.  Select _New_ when you want to create a new configuration.

Next to the list is a _Connect_ button.  The _Connect_ button will start the VNC client with the currently selected configuration.

The bottom section of the page is where you enter your connection configurations.  There are more options that will fit on the page, so this section of the page scrolls.

  _Nickname_ Each configuration you create can have a nickname which will make it easy to find in the list.  Enter that name here.

  _Password_ If your VNC server is configured to require a password, enter that password here.
