= Using android-vnc-viewer =

*android-vnc-viewer* lets you use your Android mobile device as a client for a VNC server.  It is a work in progress and still has a number of limitations: for example, it does not support display of VNC servers representing multiple monitors.

== Connection Configuration ==
When you first open *android-vnc-viewer*, you will see a connection configuration page.  Here you can set up a connection with a VNC server, or choose an already configured connection.

The page is divided into two sections.  The top section contains a drop-down list of the connection configurations you've created.  The first time you run android-vnc-viewer, this list will have only one entry: _New_.  Select _New_ when you want to create a new configuration.

Next to the list is a _Connect_ button.  The _Connect_ button will start the VNC client with the currently selected configuration.

The bottom section of the page is where you enter your connection configurations.  There are more options that will fit on the page, so this section scrolls.

  _Nickname_ Each configuration you create can have a nickname which will make it easy to find in the list.  Enter that name here.

  _Password_ If your VNC server is configured to require a password, enter that password here.  Most configuration settings are stored in a simple database on your device.  The password will only be stored if you check _Keep_; otherwise, you will have to re-enter it when you recall a configuration.  Even if the password is not stored in the database, it will remain available on the page for as long as *android-vnc-viewer* runs on your device.

  _Address_ This is where you enter the DNS name or IP address of the computer running the VNC server to which you want to connect.

  _Port_ Here you should enter the port number of the VNC server.  This field will default to the first VNC port number, 5900.

  _Color Format_ The client supports a number of color formats, which are specified by number of colors/number of bits per pixel.  Formats with more bits per pixel provide greater fidelity to high color depth displays, but use more bandwidth (sometimes dramatically more because they don't compress as well) and more CPU on your Android device.  Not all VNC servers support all color depths-- if you are having trouble connecting to a server, try using 8-bit (256 colors) or 24-bit color.

  _Force full-screen bitmap_ The VNC client requires a bitmap for it's representation of the display.  For a VNC server serving a large display, this bitmap might require more memory than Android allows in an application.  To work with these large displays, the client breaks large display into smaller tiles and works with only one tile at a time.  Unfortunately, this will sometimes create some visual artifacts.  In particular, when a large display is scaled down to display on the Android scre <a href="#FitScreen">link</a>
