= Frequently Asked Questions =

== 1. Why isn't it on Android market? ==

  We haven't wanted to expose android-vnc-viewer to the larger Android Market
  audience while it is still changing rapidly with potential sources
  of confusion.  As we gain more confidence with the state of the code,
  we supply a more complete set of features, and we
  have better documentation, we will reach a point
  where it makes sense to put it on Android Market.
  (Also, none of us has yet ponied up the $25 to be an Android Developer :) )
  In the meantime we will continue to have development builds
  available from time to time here in Google Code.
  
== 2. It says the installation failed, and now I can't even access the old version! ==

  It is safest to Uninstall the android-vnc-viewer before installing
  a new development version.  Upgrade installations may not work.  An
  upgrade installation that fails will leave you unable to run the old
  version or install a new one-- We've found that if you re-install the
  old version you had, you can then uninstall it properly and then
  install the new version.  You may need to reboot your phone before
  you can do the reinstall.

== 3. I can't log in to Real VNC Enterprise ==

  Real VNC Enterprise can use a proprietary encryption protocol over the
  standard VNC protocol.  Android VNC (and as far as I know, all other
  non-RealVNC clients) can't use this protocol.  The work-around is to
  configure the Real VNC server to use None or VNC authorization
  instead of Windows authorization; then it will use the standard
  and open protocol; you should use SSH or a VPN as an alternative
  source of encryption.  Other than that, you can politely ask
  RealVNC to supply an Android version of their client :)

== 4. I can't see the mouse cursor! ==

  Some VNC servers require the client to render the mouse cursor.
  android-vnc-viewer can't do that (yet!).

== 5. How do I right click, or send special keys? ==

  See the [Documentation User Manual].
  Hold down the camera button while clicking to
  do a right-click.
  Support for special
  keys (Control-keys, Alt-keys, Function keys, Page Up, etc.)
  is coming soon.  Ctrl-Alt-Del is available as its own
  menu function.

== 6. It doesn't work with my repeater ==

  We hope to have support for the UltraVNC repeater soon.
