= To uninstall androidVNC =

 * go to Settings from the menu at Home (or the Settings app)

From the list of options:

 * Select Applications
 * Select Manage Applications

You'll get list of installed apps

 * Select androidVNC
 * Press Uninstall button

_If you don't uninstall before you install, it will try to do an
upgrade which doesn't work for the development versions.  If this
happens to you, the install will fail and then there won't be anything
to uninstall.  If you get in this situation, reinstall the old version
you had (from the android-vnc-viewer downloads) and then you should
be able to uninstall it.  After the uninstall, the installation
of the new version will work._
