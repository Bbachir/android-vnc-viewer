From the list of options:

 * Select Applications

You'll get list of installed apps

 * Select androidVNC
 * Press Uninstall button

_If you don't uninstall before you install, it will try to do an
upgrade which doesn't work for the development versions.  If this
happens to you, the install will fail and then there won't be anything
to uninstall.  If you get in this situation, reinstall the old version
you had (from the android-vnc-viewer downloads) and then you should
be able to uninstall it.  After the uninstall, the installation
of the new version will work._

*If you have installed from Android Market, you _must_ uninstall before you can install a development version from this site.  If you've installed a development version from this site, you _must_ uninstall before you can install the Market version successfully.  Unfortunately, at this time uninstalls result in the loss of the VNC configurations you've added to your phone.*
